    answer: (
      <div>
        Monero is a privacy focused, open source cryptocurrency started in 2014.
        In many ways it works just like Bitcoin, however, every Monero
        transaction hides the sender, reciever and transaction amount.

    question: "How does tipxmr.live work in detail?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        tipxmr.live provides a full Monero wallet in the browser via
        WebAssembly. The streamer has to have a browser tab open and be logged
        in to the service to recieve donations. This provides a non-custodial,
        yet intuitive user experience.

    question: "Is tipxmr.live legal to use?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        The answer to the legality question cannot be answered genereally.
        However, all that tipxmr.live provides is a browser-based wallet and an
        automated process for streamers and donators. If XMR is legal in your
        country, tipxmr.live is as well.
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do platforms allow me to use tipxmr.live?",
    answer: (

        Since tipxmr.live integrates directly into OBS, the donations are
        encoded in the video feed when streaming. Donations can be made from
        tipxmr.live directly, which is independant of any platform.
        <br />
        We cannot guarantee that big platforms will take no action against
        accounts using tipxmr.live.
